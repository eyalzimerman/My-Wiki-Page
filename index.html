            <p>Vikings is a historical drama television series written and created by Michael Hirst for the television channel History. Filmed in Ireland, it premiered on 3 March 2013 in Canada</p>
            <p>Vikings is inspired by the sagas of Viking Ragnar Lothbrok, one of the best-known legendary Norse heroes and notorious as the scourge of England and France. The broad historical narrative is based on real events, with some of the principal characters representing real figures from history and/or legend.</p>
            <p>The show portrays Ragnar as a former farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England, and eventually becomes king, with the support of his family and fellow warriors: his brother Rollo, his son Bjorn Ironside, and his wivesâ€”the shieldmaiden Lagertha.</p>
